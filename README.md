## Introduction

In this repository, you will find data visualization projects for three distinct datasets: weather data, student data, and e-commerce purchase data. These visualizations are intended to help users better understand and derive insights from these datasets. The visualizations have been created using various data visualization libraries and tools to present the data in a clear and informative way.

## Use Cases

### Weather Data Visualization

The weather data visualization project aims to provide insights into historical weather patterns. Use cases for this project include:

- Analyzing temperature trends over time.
- Identifying seasonal weather patterns.
- Comparing precipitation and humidity levels.

### Student Data Visualization

The student data visualization project focuses on educational data to support educators and institutions. Use cases include:

- Monitoring student performance and progress.
- Identifying areas of improvement for the education system.
- Visualizing the distribution of student demographics.

### E-commerce Purchase Data Visualization

The e-commerce purchase data visualization project is designed for e-commerce businesses to gain insights into their sales and customer behavior. Use cases include:

- Analyzing sales trends and product popularity.
- Understanding customer demographics and purchase behavior.
- Evaluating the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

## Data Sources

For each of the three projects, the following data sources were used:

1. **Weather Data**: Historical weather data collected from various weather stations, typically provided in CSV format.

2. **Student Data**: Educational records containing student demographics, attendance, grades, and other relevant information. This data may be sourced from educational institutions or educational software.

3. **E-commerce Purchase Data**: Sales and customer data from e-commerce platforms, including information on products, customers, transactions, and marketing campaigns.

## Tools and Technologies

The data visualizations were created using a combination of the following tools and technologies:

- **Python**: Used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For creating interactive and documented visualizations.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: Basic data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Enhanced data visualization.
- **Plotly**: Interactive and web-based visualizations.
- **Tableau**: For advanced visualizations and dashboards.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders, each corresponding to a specific dataset:

1. **Weather Data**: Contains code and visualization files related to weather data.
2. **Student Data**: Contains code and visualization files related to student data.
3. **E-commerce Purchase Data**: Contains code and visualization files related to e-commerce purchase data.

Each of these folders contains data, Jupyter Notebooks, and visualization files specific to the respective project.

## Visualization Examples

Here are some examples of the types of visualizations you can expect to find in each project:

### Weather Data Visualization

- Line charts showing temperature trends on different location.
- Bar charts depicting monthly precipitation levels.
- Comparing precipitation, temperature and wind speed levels.
### Student Data Visualization

- Histograms showing the distribution of student grades.
- Scatter plots representing the correlation between attendance and performance.
- Pie charts showing the demographic breakdown of students.

### E-commerce Purchase Data Visualization

- Customer segmentation using clustering visualizations.
- Distrubution of popular product.

## How to Use

To explore the visualizations and gain insights from the data, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific project folder of interest (Weather Data, Student Data, or E-commerce Purchase Data).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook files to interact with the visualizations and analyze the data.

## Contributing
